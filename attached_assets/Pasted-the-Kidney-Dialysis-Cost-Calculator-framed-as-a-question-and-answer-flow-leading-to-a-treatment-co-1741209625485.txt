the Kidney Dialysis Cost Calculator, framed as a question-and-answer flow, leading to a treatment comparison. This is more a description of how the app works rather than a prompt:

The app presents a series of questions to the user, capturing information critical for cost estimation and treatment suitability. After each response, the app advances to the next relevant question.

Outcome:

After the user completes all relevant questions (dependent on branching logic), the app presents a Treatment Comparison Dashboard. This dashboard displays:

Side-by-side cost comparisons for Hemodialysis (HD), Peritoneal Dialysis (PD), and Palliative Care (if applicable).

Takes into account answers to all the questions asked above, like home suitability, caregiver costs, travel costs.

Includes non-monetary factors: time commitment, lifestyle impact, required support system, pros & cons, and quality of life factors.

Presents actionable results: Printable summary, a shareable report for healthcare providers, a checklist of next steps, relevant resource links, financial planning suggestions, and contact information for support services. The goal is to empower the user to make an informed decision based on their individual circumstances.
